## Design Decisions

### Technical Foundation

I began by cloning a previous Django project, leveraging my familiarity with the framework and its ready-made structure. Since the tool consists of both a CLI and a web interface, I integrated the CLI directly into the Django app. This enables seamless database sharing between the command-line changelog generator and the web interface that displays results.

For the frontend, I chose Bootstrap. While not my favorite, it offers quick, decent-looking UI components—ideal for a time-constrained project. Throughout development, I used LLMs primarily for routine implementation tasks, not for architectural or complex logic decisions.

### CLI Design Philosophy

Having built many CLI tools for personal use, I value flexibility and usability. This changelog generator allows users to specify commit ranges by number or date. The process is straightforward: gather relevant GitHub commits, extract their diffs, and use that context in an LLM prompt to generate changelogs.

### Visual Design Approach

Styling aimed to align with the Greptile brand. I enjoy adapting design languages from various brands, synthesizing fresh yet grounded visuals. While adaptation can sometimes border on imitation, I believe thoughtful synthesis is a valuable skill. An accidental inversion of Greptile’s green even led to discovering a striking accent pink—proof that happy accidents can inspire design.

### Current Limitations

Currently, changelogs are displayed as simple bullet points generated by the LLM. While this could be expanded with features like categorization, impact levels, or commit/PR links, the initial focus was on simplicity and functionality.


# Setup

```zsh

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/erichmond33/greptile-interview.git

cd  Greptile

# Activate the env (Mac) & install packages

. env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your Github and Greptile keys to website/keys.env

touch website/keys.env

echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here" >> website/keys.env
echo "GREPTILE_API_KEY=your_greptile_api_key_here" >> website/keys.env

```

# Run the website

```zsh

# Start localhost

python3 manage.py runserver

```

# Use the command line changelog generator

```zsh

# Use the CLI tool

python3 -m website.cli

```
