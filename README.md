First I'll clone an old web project I did.
It uses Django which I'm very familar with and will have a lot of the bones already in place.

Since this project has two parts that are closely related, I'll build the CLI tool within the Django app, so it can easily read and write to the database that will be used to display the changelog.



I'll also use bootstrap for decent looking forms and whatnot – it isn't my favorite because it is so bland, but for time...

Of course I'll also be using LLMs to help me code – mainly just saving keystrokes since this is a straightforward assignment.



I create a lot of CLI tools for my own personal workflows.

I think it makes sense to give the option of choosing a number of commits or a date range.

What I'm doing here is collecting all the Github commits and pasting their diff files into the context of the prompt.




For styling I wanted to do something that flows with the Greptile website. I find adapting brand design practices fun and challeging – kind of like asking, how would it look if Nike did it?

I'm pretty good at being a design chameleon – be a chameleon with many different websites as inspritation and you have a whole new design langague.

I'm afriad you could make the arguement that I'm not good at design and just copied yours, 

Haha I accidentally inverted your greptile green color and it is a really nice accent pink.




The way I'm displaying the changelogs is super simplistic. This could be improved with an idea of more specfic company needs.

The change-logs generated by the LLM are simple bullet points.
